### Developed this app as a Task for Android Developer Internship at MathonGo.

**Firstly app loads the data form server through an api call Using Retrofit, then shows it in UI as Un Attempted questions by rendering them from LaTeX format.
Then user can start attempting questions on clicking them, All the attempted questions stored locally using Room Database and can be seen (without internet connection also) by applying a filter as Attempted questions.**
